Greedy Strategy:
For the Greedy Strategy, when it's the computer's turn,

- IF the pile size is > 3, the computer will take the max # of sticks possible per turn, 3
- ELSE if the pile size is 1, the human has a winning strategy, and the computer will take the last stick. The human wins.
- ELSE the computer will take all but the last stick (a scenario where the pile size is 2). In this scenario the computer has developed a winning strategy and leaves the last stick for the human to take.


Random Strategy:

For the Random Strategy to ensure the class randomly chooses (with equal likelihood) the number of sticks selected, according to the game's rules ... When it is the computer's turn, 

- IF the pile size is 1 - the computer must take the last stick, The human has developed a winning strategy; hence, the human wins.

- OR IF the pile size is 2 - the computer must take 1 stick, forcing the human to take the last stick. The computer has developed a winning strategy; hence, the computer wins.

- ELSE IF the pile size is 3 - the computer will either randomly take 1 or 2 sticks leaving 1 or 2 left for the human. This ensures there is equal likelihood the computer or human could win (as stated in the instructions).

- ELSE the pile size is > 3 - the computer will randomly select a stick between 1 and 3. At least 1 stick must be drawn during each turn, but no more than 3 can be taken in a single turn.
