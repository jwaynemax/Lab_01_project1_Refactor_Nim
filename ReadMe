To resolve this comment called out during Lab 03 grading, 'Unfortunately the random strategy still does not function properly for a pile size of 1 or 3,' I've made the following updates to my random strategy class.

For the Random Strategy to ensure the class randomly chooses (with equal likelihood) the number of sticks selected, according to the game's rules ... When it is the computer's turn, 

- IF the pile size is 1 - the computer must take the last stick, The human has developed a winning strategy; hence, the human wins.

- OR IF the pile size is 2 - the computer must take 1 stick, forcing the human to take the last stick. The computer has developed a winning strategy; hence, the computer wins.

- ELSE IF the pile size is 3 - the computer will either randomly take 1 or 2 sticks leaving 1 or 2 left for the human. This ensures there is equal likelihood the computer or human could win (as stated in the instructions).

- ELSE the pile size is > 3 - the computer will randomly select a stick between 1 and 3. At least 1 stick must be drawn during each turn, but no more than 3 can be taken in a single turn.
