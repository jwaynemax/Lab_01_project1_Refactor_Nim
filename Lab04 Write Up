1. Restart game using same first player
	- 4 points
	- In class StatusPane, in the Invalidated() method, I added a check for IF the game was over. IF YES, call method 'restartGame' which creates a button (btnRestartGame)
	that when clicked (the event) will call the event handler RestartGameListner. This event first creates a new variable for player by setting it to the current games
	first player. To get this value, in the Game class, I created a new data field for 'firstPlayer' with getters and setters that is initialized by startNewGame() when
	called in class NimPane's ComputerFirstListener or HumanFirstListener. I then close the current stage by getting it from class Game's stage data field, which is initialized
	after a new Game is created in class Main via a setter method. This way, I do not have to pass the stage created in Main as a parameter in Game's constructor. Stage can
	be retrieved with a getter found in class Game. Next, I declare a new Main method. In my Main class, I've created a new data field, 'firstPlayer' with a setter method
	to set the value of firstPlayer. Finally, in event handler RestartGameListner, I call main's start() method which will initialize a new game and new scene. I've added
	an IF condition to check for IF firstPlayer is not null. If false, there is not a prior first player that should be set for the game. If true, in Game >> setFirstPlayer
	set firstPlayer to the value passed in by the previous game (which has ended). Then, in NimPane >> NewGamePane, I've added a check to verify if Game's firstPlayer
	data field is not null and check what its class is. If the firstPlayer field has content and is of class ComputerPlayer - call the computerFirstListener. Else, call the
	HumanFirstListener. 
	- With this series of checks, I'm able to restart the game by the click of a button via the Main method. This ensures the game's entry point goes through the same flow
	and a new JavaFX scene is created for each new game. A number of IF statements and methods needed to be added to capture the firstPlayer selected in the first game to make
	default first player in following games. 
	
2. Computer automatically takes turn without 'Take Turn' button
	- 4 points
	- In class ComputerPane, I created a new Label type field for takingTurn. In method buildPane() I set the value of this label to  "Computer is taking turn..." and 
	specified its placement. Then I set it's default visibility to false. In the Invalidated() method, I refactored the myTurn check to verify, IF it is myTurn, set the
	label's visibility to true, then add logic for a 'PauseTransition' of 2 seconds, so that the end user understands that the computer is taking their turn. This calls 
	the existing TakeTurnListener. If it is not the computer's turn, the label for lblNumberTaken should be set to the value of number of sticks taken, and the label for
	takingTurn set back to invisible. 
	- The logic for the computer to take it's turn already existed; however, it needed an event to trigger the listener TakeTurnListener. Doing this immediately when it 
	was the computer's turn wouldn't work, as the method would be called so quickly on the frontend, the ComputerPane would never appear enabled. To resolve this, I added
	the label which only appears while the Computer is 'taking it's turn' and associated the event to a PauseTransition. This give the human user a chance to process that
	the computer is actually taking it's turn.
